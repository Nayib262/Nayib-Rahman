# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO: For the final project I plan on writing a code for a tic tac toe game. The game can be playable between two players and will play out like an actual tic tac toe game. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO: Drew Lockard

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO: How can I make the code for the tic tac toe game a bit more advanced because there's not much you can change up from a game.
