# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

#Tic Tac Toe game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#My project will be a traditional tic tac toe game where two players can compete against each other. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

#The project will include two players who will play a traditional tic tac toe game. The two players will be "x" and "o" and the player that has mark "x" will go first 
and then it will be the player "o". The game will continue on until it detects 3 in a row from any column/row, which will then declare whichever mark that got that as 
the winner. If there is a draw and no one got three in a row, the game will call it as a draw. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

#N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

#A good outcome of the final project will be the game detecting a winner when one of the marks reaches 3 in a row. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#The better outcome is when it is compatible to play against the computer. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#The best outcome would be if the game is able to detect the two players, it can detect who wins, who loses, and if they both draw. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

#The skills we will need to complete this project is learning how to use giphy and how to add pictures inside of python to create the tic tac toe game background. We 
will also need to learn how to make the computer detect who won because if we just leave it as it is, it will show someone got 3 in a row, but the game can still be 
able to go on, which would be wrong. We will most likely work on the code together, and we can split it up to one person doing a certain code like the lines and location,
and the other person that can try to detect if there was a victory.
